# Dataset: Tabular Playground Series - Oct 21
 Predicting a binary target based on a number of feature columns given in the data. The columns are a mix of scaled continuous features and binary features.
The data is synthetically generated by a GAN that was trained on real-world molecular response data.

# Used XGBoost and Memory Reduction Algorithm for prediction.

# This is from a hackathon from Kaggle ranked 104/759
